title: Texas' Energy: A National Curiosity
subtitle: The Lone Star state stands alone compared to the rest of the US; Texas’ energy market is deregulated allowing for high levels of competition between providers and greater innovation.

## Historical Background
There are three distinct, separate power grids, or “interconnections”, in the US:

Did you notice Texas? **Texas has its own state-level interconnection known as ERCOT: the Electric Reliability Council of Texas**. It covers the majority of Texas, but two small areas to the northwest and northeast of Texas, including El Paso, are split between the Western Interconnection and the Eastern Interconnection. These two interconnections are split along the Rocky Mountains. ERCOT services 75% of Texas land, and manages 85% of all the power transmitted in the state. [1](https://www.texastribune.org/2013/10/29/texplainer-how-texas-grid-managed/)

Historically, utility companies, the main power generating entities in the early 20th century, worked independently and supplied electrical energy to consolidated local areas. After Edison laid the foundation for the transport of electrical energy these companies tended to pop up sporadically. During World War 1 these companies began connecting their regional power grids, and during World War 2 the Texas Interconnect System was founded. This allowed hydroelectric facilities along rivers and dams in Texas to be able to send energy to many of the Texas factories that were aiding the war effort. 

Due to the state-level nature of the Texas Interconnect System they were adamant about retaining Texas’ state rights over their energy systems- **they worked hard to keep federal regulation at bay**. By not crossing state lines, these unified utility companies managed to subvert the Federal Power Act by Franklin Roosevelt. This is the historical precedent that paved the path for Texas’ growth in energy infrastructure. Self reliance was made easier by the fact that Texas is a state abundant in natural resources: plentiful river access, fossil fuel stocks, and area for harnessing wind energy in the future.

ERCOT formed in 1970 after a major blackout in the northeast in November 1965, which happened to be the worst blackout in national history. ERCOT was tasked with grid reliability in accordance with national standards, and to reiterate; ERCOT is not under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. **This “single-state jurisdiction” has allowed Texas to more rapidly expand and improve its infrastructure compared to the rest of the country**. This fact will continue to pop up as I explain Texas’ energy statistics and growth. [2](https://www.texastribune.org/2011/02/08/texplainer-why-does-texas-have-its-own-power-grid/)
