### Key Features
StaticFrame is neither a clone of Pandas nor a replacement. StaticFrame is a library _similar_ to Pandas with strong design decisions focusing on uniformity, explicit behavior, immutability, and less redundancy in functionality. At it's core StaticFrame is a library that implements efficient and powerful data structures, while not trying to do it all- it doesn't offer any visualization tooling for example. Pandas is not a requirement for StaticFrame, but NumPy is because NumPy offers a lot in terms of stability, data structures, and flat out speed for operations.
