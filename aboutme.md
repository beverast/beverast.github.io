title: About me
---

My name is Joseph Wagner. Here are some quick facts about me:

- I'm a fellow of Lambda School studying data science.
- I'm always looking to help with FOSS projects. Can I help? Let's get in touch!
- I'm most interested in big data & data engineering.  

My interests:

- Python & programming language design
- Functional programming
- Metaheuristics & optimization
- Blockchains & distributed systems


### My history
I started programming for my high school's FIRST FRC robotics team, working with LabView. Since then, my interests in tech have grown to include programming language technology, machine learning, data engineering/big data, and principles of software engineering. I'm currently a student at Lambda School, and if you're interested in seeing what I'm currently working on go check out my repositories (GitHub link in the footer). Aside from programming and research, I am also passionate about playing music (Does Guitar Hero count too?), reading, hiking, and downhill skating.
