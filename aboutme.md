My name is Joseph Wagner. Here are some quick facts about me:

- I'm a data science student at Lambda School.
- I'm always looking to help with FOSS projects. Can I help? Let's get in touch!
- I'm most interested in financial and market data analysis. 
- My favorite color is gray, and I usually program to the tunes of Aphex Twin. 


### My history
I first discovered programming in the eighth grade with Visual Basic 2008. Consequently I spent the next four years as a programmer for my high school's FIRST FRC robotics team, working with NI LabView and various APIs. After high school I spent two years at Purdue University learning computer science. Why Lambda School and not continue with a good university? Two reasons: aligned incentives and an education rooted in real-world application. I'm writing this in my third week with Lambda School, and I can already say that I've written more code with them than I ever did at Purdue, and its all code that adds to a skillset that's valuable to employers- not just discrete math toys and linked lists. Aside from programming and research, I am also passionate about adventuring in the outdoors, playing music, reading, and downhill skating for an adrenaline rush.
