My name is Joseph Wagner. Here are some quick facts about me:

- I'm a data science student at Lambda School.
- I'm always looking to help with FOSS projects. Can I help? Let's get in touch!
- I'm most interested in financial and markets data analysis. 
- My favorite color is gray, and I usually program to the tunes of Aphex Twin. 

My interests:

- Python & programming language design
- Economics and forecasting
- Metaheuristics & optimization
- Blockchains and distributed systems theory


### My history
I started programming for my high school's FIRST FRC robotics team, working with LabView. Since then, my interests in tech have grown to include programming language technology, data science/analytics and machine learning, software engineering principles, and optimization. As I stated in the quick facts I'm currently a student at Lambda School, and if you're interested in seeing what I do as a student go ahead and check out my weekly forked repositories (GitHub link in the footer). Aside from programming and research, I am also passionate about adventuring in the outdoors, playing music, reading, and downhill skating for an adrenaline rush.
